**Throughout the semester**, I've learned how some systems and certain designs were actually much simpler to add and implement than I previously imagined they were. The one that I think of the most is the implementation of web forms- The fact that a few line of codes are able to fully construct a survey form, AND a location to view every single submitted form, was very intriguing to me, I thought there was much more going on behind the scenes there until now. 

When I first signed up for this class and completed **Weeks 1-3** of the course, I was wondering how much more there REALLY was to learn with HTML. I learned how to embed images, links, and change the basic design of bodies of text and its background, *and I thought that there wasn't much passed that.*

I was very much wrong.

**Week 5** was when I started learning about how much accessibility affects the design of a page, and how much of the design relies on it. Seeing a website look completely different when viewed in the slightest change in dimensions was a bit of a wake-up call, and it made me start thinking differently when adding certain sections to my site, especially media and gallery photos. Trying to make a website look polished on two completely different devices was a real challenge, especially when working with tables and groups of text/images. 

Overall, there's a few key things I learned about web page development throughout the course that I won't forget.
- If you don't fix a mistake early on, it'll cause more and more problems the longer it goes unnoticed, so it's vital to constantly check your work.
<sub>I've fallen victim to this many times, due to me getting too comfortable with my code and losing track of certain pieces.</sub>
- You need to design a page for more than just yourself. Other people with different eyes and different methods of access are going to be viewing your page, and you need to make sure to not cut corners with design just because you're able to access it easily.

**The color scheme** of my website was designed to use a bold shade of teal `#BAFBE5`, then different types of bluish-grays `#367A64`, blacks `#00000`, whites `white`, and the occasional beige `blanchedalmond` to keep a simple, accessible look. Teal clashes very easily with other colors, like primary red `red` and yellow `yellow`, so I knew that if I used it, I would probably have to stick with darker and lighter hues of that same teal `#367A64` `azure`, and I think it worked pretty well. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but the text is easy to read, and it isn't overpowering by any means.
