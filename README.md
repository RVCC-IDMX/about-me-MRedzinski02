**Throughout the semester**, I've learned how some systems and certain designs were actually much simpler to add and implement than I previously imagined they were. The one that I think of the most is the implementation of web forms- The fact that a few line of codes are able to fully construct a survey form, AND a location to view every single submitted form, was very intriguing to me, I thought there was much more going on behind the scenes there until now. 

When I first signed up for this class and completed **Weeks 1-3** of the course, I was wondering how much more there REALLY was to learn with HTML. I learned how to embed images, links, and change the basic design of bodies of text and its background, *and I thought that there wasn't much passed that.*

I was very much wrong.

**Week 5** was when I started learning about how much accessibility affects the design of a page, and how much of the design relies on it. Seeing a website look completely different when viewed in the slightest change in dimensions was a bit of a wake-up call, and it made me start thinking differently when adding certain sections to my site, especially media and gallery photos. Trying to make a website look polished on two completely different devices was a real challenge, especially when working with tables and groups of text/images. 

**The color scheme** of my website was designed to use a bold shade of teal `#BAFBE5`, then different types of bluish-grays `#367A64`, blacks `#00000`, whites `white`, and the occasional beige `blanchedalmond` to keep a simple, accessible look. Teal clashes very easily with other colors, like primary red `red` and yellow `yellow`, so I knew that if I used it, I would probably have to stick with darker and lighter hues of that same teal `#367A64` `azure`, and I think it worked pretty well. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but the text is easy to read, and it isn't overpowering by any means.
