    <h2>Matthew Redzinski, RVCC Graphic Design Student</h2>
    <h2>Quick Biography</h2>
     <p>Raised in Phillipsburg, NJ and currently living in High Bridge. I'm currently learning graphic design at RVCC, and am going to graduate with an Associates degree in the spring.
        I decided on graphic design when I was trying to find out what the most sustainable and modern art degree was, and what had potential to secure a good job. I found out about
        graphic design, how it can be a combination of both freelance AND company-hired work, and how it can be useful to almost any company and organization, so that way there will always
        be a market for it. I'm still pretty confident in my choice, and made sure to take electives that sort of tied-in to the profession, such as web page design and audio production. They
        don't pertain to graphic design specifically, but they're useful to know about and be self-sufficient in in case I wanted to make more ambitious projects revolving around my graphic 
        work. Before I settled on graphic design, I was sort of having a crisis with how I wanted to express myself creatively- I knew I wanted to create <em>something,</em> I just wasn't sure 
        what to create, or how I'd do it. I've dabbled in so many different forms of art and creation, like YouTube videos, comics, animation, even some videogame design. Right before graduating
         high school, though, I found out that I had a pretty good natural ability to create neat, simple logos that small online organizations loved. I did some work for eSports organizations 
         on Twitter to help build a portfolio, and the rest is history. I'm hoping to go far beyond what I've already done and keep adding on to what I've learned to make some truly great 
         pieces of art. If I can leave my imprint on the world in some way, even if it is with just some little logo for some random company, I still think that's pretty cool.

    <h2>My Hobbies/Interests:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Videogames (Who would've guessed)-</strong> I play a lot of different 
            games but my biggest ones right now are League and Smash Ultimate.
            I actually used to travel around the state here and there
            and compete at tournaments and I met a lot of cool people
            that way. But for now I'm just focusing on school and work</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness-</strong> Over the last year I decided I wanted to see what
            the gym would do for me physically and mentally. I went from 
            204 pounds to 157 in a little over a year and one week, and am
            still making progress with it. Very happy I decided to commit
        </li>
        <li><strong>Music-</strong> I almost always have music playing. I had no idea how
            to represent that with an image so I used the funko pop my uncle
            got me a while back to represent that LOL. My favorite artists right now
            are probably Post Malone, Amine, Kanye, and Baby Keem
        </li>
        <li><strong>Design-</strong> I like making graphics for small organizations or friends.
            Because of my connections with the smash ultimate community i've been
            able to make some stuff for pretty big audiences, and it's helped me
            a lot with stepping my foot in the door. My biggest collaborator so far is  I'll try to post some of my work in the photo gallery.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Some Other Interests:</strong> Skyrim, animation, hip-hop, sushi, illustration, game design</li>

            of hosting a tournament where the players only consisted of stream snipers (stream snipers are players that purposely time their queues so that they match up with
            the streamer they're watching). I made fake advertisements to keep the viewers entertained in-between tournament sets, and the audience reaction was awesome, everyone loved them and they are
            still an inside joke months later. The first of this series of images is the main promotional poster for the event, designed to look like
            a crime investigation board.</em></strong></figcaption>

    <h2>Dracula</h2>

    <div>
<em><strong>
        <p>18 August.--I am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the churchyard. Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she were in any way an√¶mic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I needed any reminding, of that night, and that it was here, on this very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--</p>

        <p>"My poor little feet didn't make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr. Swales would have told me that it was because I didn't want to wake up Geordie." As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered look came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her habit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don't wonder that he does. Then she went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to herself:--</p>
    
        <p>"I didn't quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be here in this spot--I don't know why, for I was afraid of something--I don't know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air. I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me, and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do it before I felt you."</p>
