<!--BEFORE YOU BEGIN- I was unable to get the hamburger menu setup. I'm not sure why, but that part of the final was extremely confusing and there was nothing I could really do to be able
to wrap my head around it, things just stopped making sense at that point. There was too much going on, and it got to the point where it was stunting my progress with the other parts of the final, so I thought it would be best to
simply submit what I had, considering I'm pretty confident I won't be able to get the hamburger menu working. I can assure you that every other part of the final, I made sure was truly my 
final design.-->

    <h2>Matthew Redzinski, RVCC Graphic Design Student</h2>
    <h2>Quick Biography</h2>
    
     <p>Raised in Phillipsburg, NJ and currently living in High Bridge. I'm currently learning graphic design at RVCC, and am going to graduate with an Associates degree in the spring.
        I decided on graphic design when I was trying to find out what the most sustainable and modern art degree was, and what had potential to secure a good job. I found out about
        graphic design, how it can be a combination of both freelance AND company-hired work, and how it can be useful to almost any company and organization, so that way there will always
        be a market for it. I'm still pretty confident in my choice, and made sure to take electives that sort of tied-in to the profession, such as web page design and audio production. They
        don't pertain to graphic design specifically, but they're useful to know about and be self-sufficient in in case I wanted to make more ambitious projects revolving around my graphic 
        work. Before I settled on graphic design, I was sort of having a crisis with how I wanted to express myself creatively- I knew I wanted to create <em>something,</em> I just wasn't sure 
        what to create, or how I'd do it. I've dabbled in so many different forms of art and creation, like YouTube videos, comics, animation, even some videogame design. Right before graduating
         high school, though, I found out that I had a pretty good natural ability to create neat, simple logos that small online organizations loved. I did some work for eSports organizations 
         on Twitter to help build a portfolio, and the rest is history. I'm hoping to go far beyond what I've already done and keep adding on to what I've learned to make some truly great 
         pieces of art. If I can leave my imprint on the world in some way, even if it is with just some little logo for some random company, I still think that's pretty cool.

    <h2>My Hobbies/Interests:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Videogames (Who would've guessed)-</strong> I play a lot of different 
            games but my biggest ones right now are League and Smash Ultimate.
            I actually used to travel around the state here and there
            and compete at tournaments and I met a lot of cool people
            that way. But for now I'm just focusing on school and work</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness-</strong> Over the last year I decided I wanted to see what
            the gym would do for me physically and mentally. I went from 
            204 pounds to 157 in a little over a year and one week, and am
            still making progress with it. Very happy I decided to commit
        </li>
        <li><strong>Music-</strong> I almost always have music playing. I had no idea how
            to represent that with an image so I used the funko pop my uncle
            got me a while back to represent that LOL. My favorite artists right now
            are probably Post Malone, Amine, Kanye, and Baby Keem
        </li>
        <li><strong>Design-</strong> I like making graphics for small organizations or friends.
            Because of my connections with the smash ultimate community i've been
            able to make some stuff for pretty big audiences, and it's helped me
            a lot with stepping my foot in the door. My biggest collaborator so far is  I'll try to post some of my work in the photo gallery.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Some Other Interests:</strong> Skyrim, animation, hip-hop, sushi, illustration, game design</li>

    <h2>Blog Post- CSS Animation</h2>

    <div>
<em><strong>
<!-- RESEARCH 500+ WORDS- TOPIC: CSS ANIMATION -->        
<p>

While reading the instructions for the Final, I actually found something that was possible to do in css without knowing it existed before- CSS animation! At first, I didn't think they
meant it <em>literally</em> when they used the term "animation," but it actually is legitimate animation, keyframes and all, not just an illusion. There are some main elements that allow
CSS animation to function, including: <em><strong>keyframes, animation-name, animation-duration, animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, animation-timing-function, 
    animation-fill-mode, and animation. Two of the most important elements are keyframes and animation-duration- It's the animator's way of telling the program how many frames it should take to change an element 
from form A to form B. More keyframes makes the change take more time, and will appear slower, while less keyframes make the change more spontaneous and instant. Animation-delay determines 
how many frames will pass before the animation actually begins.</strong></em>
</p>

<section id = anim></section>

<p>
See how the square takes a few seconds to start moving and changing color? <em>That's because there's a two second delay on the animation before it begins.</em>
</p>

<p>
Animation-iteration-count is a fancy way of saying how many times the animation will loop.    
</p>

<section id = anim2></section>

<p>
Because this animation is set to have infinite iterations, it's stuck on a permanent loop. It will continue to move from side to side forever, using the same amount of keyframes everytime.
I find it a little strange that infinite looping is not the default setting for CSS animations, considering that smooth, repeated movements are what give life to the backgrounds of most 
websites nowadays, but I can see why it gives you the option rather than serving it as the default, there's more freedom that way.
</p>

<p>
This is where CSS animation elements begin to become a bit more challenging and complex. Starting with animation-direction, this element gives you the ability to reverse or alternate 
the path that you set with your animation. The reverse option sends the animation backwards, while the alternate option sends the animation forward for one iteration, then backwards for the next, 
continuing for however many iterations the programmer has set.     
</p>

<section id = anim3></section>

<p>
In this example, the animation is set to have a reversed alternate direction. Because of this, the animation above it will sync up every other iteration, and then split off during the next.
</p>

<p>
Animation-timing-function is what makes smooth CSS animation possible. This element alters the speed of the animation at the start and end points to allow for a more smooth, less spontaneous 
sense of movement (or, if you use the linear option, it does the opposite, and makes the animation much more static and inorganic). Below is an example of eased timing, and the one afterwards is linear.
</p>

<section id = anim4a></section>
<section id = anim4b></section>

<p>
Linear timing makes the animation crash back and forth, and appears much less passive than the smoothness of eased CSS animation. In most cases, CSS animations are eased, and it's even
eased as default.    
</p>

<p>
Animation-fill-mode determines how a certain object will be handled once it has concluded its animation. Typically, CSS animations do not affect an element's appearance or style once 
the animation has concluded, unless animation-fill-mode is used. The forwards option keeps the object as it was when the animation ended, while the backwards option keeps it as it was 
before the animation began.
</p>

<section id = anim5></section>

<p>In this animation, the backwards option is used to make the object go back to its original color once the animation concluded. Obviously, if the iteration count was set to infinite, 
    this setting would not work or need to be used at all, since the animation will never end and there will be no point in setting the object's appearance after the animation ends.
</p>

<section id = anim6a></section>
<section id = anim6b></section>
<section id = anim6c></section>
<section id = anim6d></section>
<section id = anim6e></section>
<section id = anim6f></section>

<p>When working together and using all different elements of CSS animation, you can make really simple, stunning visual effects! This animation was used using only what was previously discussed. 
    CSS animation is able to give life to an otherwise static form of code. Although video embedding and media inclusion can help with this, using the actual HTML itself to create organic, moving 
    visual effects is the most effective way to bring life to a webpage. It's extremely simple to do, and can really make a difference in the long run, so it's worth implementing whenever possible.
