    <h2>My Hobbies/Interests:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Videogames (Who would've guessed)-</strong> I play a lot of different 
            games but my biggest ones right now are League and Smash Ultimate.
            I actually used to travel around the state here and there
            and compete at tournaments and I met a lot of cool people
            that way. But for now I'm just focusing on school and work</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness-</strong> Over the last year I decided I wanted to see what
            the gym would do for me physically and mentally. I went from 
            204 pounds to 157 in a little over a year and one week, and am
            still making progress with it. Very happy I decided to commit
        </li>
        <li><strong>Music-</strong> I almost always have music playing. I had no idea how
            to represent that with an image so I used the funko pop my uncle
            got me a while back to represent that LOL. My favorite artists right now
            are probably Post Malone, Amine, Kanye, and Baby Keem
        </li>
        <li><strong>Design-</strong> I like making graphics for small organizations or friends.
            Because of my connections with the smash ultimate community i've been
            able to make some stuff for pretty big audiences, and it's helped me
            a lot with stepping my foot in the door.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Some Other Interests:</strong> Skyrim, animation, hip-hop, sushi, illustration, game design</li>
    </ul>
